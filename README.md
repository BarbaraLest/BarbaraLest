### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Barbara Rodrigues
#### Welcome to my github profile <3
About me? Trying to be a mobile developer and studying computer science at the Federal Technological University of ParanÃ¡, I currently work as mobile development at SWA Sistemas.
I have interests in the areas of mobile development, UX/UI, front-end among other things and most of my repositories are about studies in these areas.
Aaaaaah, one more thing about my repositories: sometimes I write the readmes in English, sometimes in Portuguese. Don't judge me and Ã© nois!
